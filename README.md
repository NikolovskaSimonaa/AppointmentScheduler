# Appointment Scheduler

This project is an android application for scheduling appointments on a weekly basis. New appointments for the following week are released every weekend. The users can book appointments only on free time slots. These free time slots are managed with two conditions:

1. If the time slot has already passed for this week, it would get disabled and the users would not be able to pick that time slot. For example, if the current time is 12pm and the current day is Wednesday, all the time slots before 12pm on Wednesday will be disabled.

2. If specific time slot is already taken by some user, that specific time slot would get disabled for the other users. Users also have the opportunity to view their timetable with information when are their appointments this week.
